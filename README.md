# WebSum
Android project that uses a simple web-service developed on PHP that receives two numbers from the mobile application, and adds those two values, returning the final result to the application.

The project handles the HTTP communication between the application and the services using two different libraries:

- OkHttp (http://square.github.io/okhttp/)
- Volley (https://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html)
